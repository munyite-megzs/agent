 A local property agent in Nairobi is having issues keeping track of the available property on the market. He is looking for a solution that will enable him to create listings of 
available properties on the market. For starters he wants his application to be accessible to him for data entry before he releases it to the market. 
Create a rails app that will allow him to CRUD property data.

Note: Each type of property should be accesible from its own url i.e

localhost:3000/apartments -- should list all apartments
localhost:3000/bedsitters -- should list all bedsitters
